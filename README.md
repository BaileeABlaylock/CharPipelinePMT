Character Animation Pipeline Project Management Tool (PMT)

I created this Project Management Tool (PMT) for the character animation pipeline using python scripting and PyQt5. The Other Ones Studio consists of two departments; The Other Ones Games and The Other Ones Films. The script creates a set directory structure on opening the program. The user can then create and delete projects from the Projects tab and create, delete, and open Maya assets from the assets tab. All of the projects and assets will remain accessible after the user closes the program because the tool reflects an actual directory.
As a work in progress, I would like to later implement :
- Configuration settings to ensure that the user is using the correct version of software
- More interesting UI design
- A system that checks to see if a model is created before creating a rig, and a rig is created before creating an animation.
